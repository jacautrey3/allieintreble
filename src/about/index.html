          <h2 class="section-title">About Allie</h2>
          <p>I am a lifelong singer, pianist, and performer who believes every voice deserves to be heard and cared for.</p>
          <p>I began singing at a young age, my mom used to say I was the living embodiment of the lyrics of &ldquo;Thank You for the Music&rdquo; by ABBA: &ldquo;&hellip;she says I began to sing long before I could talk.&rdquo; I started piano lessons at six and grew up in choirs and musical theatre programs.</p>
          <p>From 2012&ndash;2016, I studied voice with a classical focus, building a strong technical foundation in breath control, posture, projection, and vocal health. I performed in multiple choirs and musical theatre productions, developing harmony, sight-reading, and ensemble skills, one choir was even selected to perform at Carnegie Hall.</p>
          <p>From 2016&ndash;2020, I continued training in contemporary styles, learning to belt and mix-belt safely and connect chest and head voice seamlessly. I remained active in choirs, attended vocal camps, and completed college-level coursework in voice, music theory, and production.</p>
          <p>From 2020 to 2025, I performed regularly throughout the Bay Area in multiple cover bands (Misspent Youth, Late at Last, Decoy!, and Hella Doubtful) while continuing my own vocal studies. I strongly believe that maintaining your instrument is essential, whether you sing professionally or personally, that&rsquo;s why I still take lessons myself and further my education of the voice by taking courses.</p>
          <p>As a teacher, I prioritize confidence, healthy technique, and joy. I&rsquo;ve taught voice and piano to students of various ages and experience levels, tailoring lessons to each individual rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach. Our first lesson is conversational, allowing me to understand your background, voice, and goals. My style is supportive, encouraging, and centered on helping you feel confident and empowered in your own voice.</p>
